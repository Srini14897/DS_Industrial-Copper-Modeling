# DS_Industrial-Copper-Modeling

## Project Overview

The Industrial Copper Modeling project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting copper prices in the manufacturing industry. The project will focus on addressing data challenges, such as skewness and noisy data, and building regression and classification models to predict continuous variable 'Selling_Price' and binary variable 'Status' (WON or LOST) respectively. Additionally, a user-friendly Streamlit web application will be created to allow users to make predictions on new data.

## Skills Gained from This Project

Throughout this project, participants will gain proficiency in the following areas:

1. Python scripting for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, outlier detection using IQR or Isolation Forest, and data normalization.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Machine learning modeling for regression and classification tasks using Scikit-learn.
5. Feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
6. Creating an interactive web application using Streamlit to showcase the trained models and make predictions on new data.
7. Maintaining code on GitHub in a modular and maintainable manner.
8. Writing a proper README file to document the project and its execution.

## Problem Statement

The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing, but it may suffer from skewness and noisy data that affects manual predictions' accuracy. The project aims to create machine learning models that can handle these challenges and accurately predict copper prices and lead statuses.

## Data

The dataset contains information on copper prices and various features relevant to the manufacturing industry. The data will be preprocessed, and features will be engineered to train the machine learning models.

## Approach

The project will follow these key steps:

1. Data Understanding: Identify variable types and distributions, treat invalid values, and handle categorical variables appropriately.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values using mean/median/mode, treat outliers using IQR or Isolation Forest, and transform skewed continuous variables using appropriate techniques.
3. EDA: Visualize outliers and skewness before and after preprocessing using boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new informative features if applicable and drop highly correlated columns.
5. Regression Model: Train and evaluate a regression model to predict 'Selling_Price' using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. Classification Model: Train and evaluate a classification model to predict 'Status' (WON or LOST) using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. Streamlit Web Application: Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit to predict 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' based on user inputs.

## Project Evaluation Metrics

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Modularity and maintainability of the code.
2. Properly documented README file describing the project and its execution.
3. Code hosted on GitHub with a public repository.
4. Adherence to Python coding standards (PEP-8).
5. Creation of a demo video showcasing the working model and shared on LinkedIn.

Participants are encouraged to use version control, create branches for different tasks, and write clean, well-organized, and documented code.

By the end of this project, participants will have gained valuable experience in data analysis, machine learning modeling, web application development, and applying these skills to real-world problems in the manufacturing domain.
